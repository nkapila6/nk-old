Sacrifice is a very poweful tool.

Just thinking of the term "sacrifice" helps me in thinking more transparently. So transparent that I do not even need someone's opinion to verify whether I'm on the right or wrong path.

We often have this feeling of self-importance or pride we carry within ourself. Probably, this feeling is what we think of ourself in the future.

This very thinking is just toxicity in it's best form.
This pride or thought process as I would like to call it, helps in restraining our actions in one form or the other.

Actions of empathy, compassion, kindness etc.
But, why? Why go on this path of life? We're only human after all. :)

We feel the same way, think the same way, live in similar ways.

Try to look at things from a different perspective.
Help others, be kind & most of all, do what is best for yourself.

This kind of thinking only comes with transparency.

And always remember this:

- Basic thinking influence your habits.
- Habits influence your thought process, and,
- Your thought process is what gets translated into actions.

So,

TL;DR: "Don't let your pride blind you." \~ Master Yi
