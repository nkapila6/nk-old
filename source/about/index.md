<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋</h1>
I'm Nikhil. I'm pursuing my MS in CS from [Georgia Tech](https://github.com/gatech). 

In my day-job, I work as lighting engineer with expertise in lighting components and controls. All fields (even lighting) are converging towards Tech and I hope to contribute in the near future to bridge this gap.

My time at Georgia Tech has gotten me deeply intrigued into mathematics, machine learning and all things Bayesian. In my free time, I try to update my *inductive priors* on these topics as much as possible. 🙃

🐛 Courses taken: 
- ✅ Human Computer Interaction (Spring 2023)
- ✅ Knowledge-Based AI (Summer 2023)
- ✅ Software Development Processes (Fall 2023)
- ✅ Machine Learning (Spring 2024)
- ✅ Research Work (Summer 2024)
- ⏲ Deep Learning (Fall 2024)
